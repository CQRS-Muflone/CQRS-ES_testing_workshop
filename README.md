# A CQRS microservice with event sourcing, from develop to non conventional testing
This is the repository for the [Practical Event Sourcing and Testing Workshop](https://www.avanscoperta.it/it/training/practical-event-sourcing-and-testing-workshop/).
The scope is to show a way to test events in a CQRS with event sourcing application.

# This is the exercise branch *

## Prerequisites
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com "RabbitMQ's Homepage")
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com "MongoDB's Homepage")
* [Event Store](https://eventstore.com/downloads/ "Event store's Homepage") Download EventStoreDB 5.0.8

## Notes
Be sure to set the solution to run multiple project and enable CqrsMovie.Seats.API and CqrsMovie.Website

Muflone is a library that we use, and are still implementing, based on the great work of Jonathan Oliver with [CommonDomain as part of NEventStore](https://github.com/NEventStore/NEventStore)
